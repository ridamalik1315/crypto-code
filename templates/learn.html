            <h3>XOR Cipher</h3>
            <p>
              XOR (exclusive-or) is a very simple symmetric operation: if two input bits are the same, the result is
              0; if they are different, the result is 1. To encrypt, we XOR each bit of the plaintext with a key; to
              decrypt, we XOR the result with the same key again, which recovers the original text.
            </p>
            <p>
              This is not secure on its own for real systems, but it is a great way to understand how stream ciphers
              and one-time pads work.

            <h3>Permutation (Transposition) Cipher</h3>
            <p>
              A permutation cipher does not change the characters themselves; it only reorders them. We split the
              message into blocks and rearrange the positions inside each block according to a numeric key such as
              <code>2013</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              To decrypt, we apply the inverse permutation, putting each character back in its original position.
              Modern block ciphers like AES also use permutations internally, combined with substitution steps.

            <h3>RSA Public-Key Cipher</h3>
            <p>
              RSA is an asymmetric cipher: encryption and decryption use different keys. A public key
              <code>(e, n)</code> is used to encrypt, and a private key <code>(d, n)</code> is used to decrypt, where
              <code>n = p × q</code> for large primes <code>p</code> and <code>q</code>.
            </p>
            <p>
              Mathematically, encryption and decryption are just modular exponentiation:
              <code>cipher = plain^e mod n</code> and <code>plain = cipher^d mod n</code>. The difficulty of factoring
              <code>n</code> keeps the private key secure.

            <h3>MD5 and Brute-Force Cracking</h3>
            <p>
              MD5 is a cryptographic hash function that maps any input to a 128-bit hash. It is fast but no longer
              considered secure due to collisions and its resistance to brute-force attacks being too low for modern
              hardware.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this project, we brute-force all possible 3-character strings made of letters and digits, hash each
              one with MD5, and compare the result with a target hash. This illustrates how short, simple passwords
              can be discovered by attackers.
